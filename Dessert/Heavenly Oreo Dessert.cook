Take a #large zip lock bag{} and place all the @Double-Stuffed Oreo cookies{1%package} inside.  Seal bag shut and place on counter.  Using a #rolling pin{}, crush the cookies until they are small chunks/crumbs.  You want them to still be chunky and small, but not fine crumbs.
Set aside 1/3 of the cookie crumbs for the topping.  Pour remaining cookie crumbs into a #9x13 baking pan{}.  Pour @melted butter{1/2%cups} over the crumbs and mix well to combine.  Once combined, press into the pan to form a crust.
In a #bowl, whisk together the two @Instant Chocolate pudding mix{2%packages} packages and @milk{3.25%cups}.  Cover and place in fridge to set.
In a #medium bowl{}, blend 8 oz. block of @cream cheese{1%block} until smooth.  Slowly add in @powdered sugar{1%cup}.  Fold in one container of @Cool Whip{2%containers}.  Spread mixture over the cookie crust.  Next, take chocolate pudding and spread over the cream cheese mixture.  Spread the other container of Cool Whip over the chocolate pudding layer.  Sprinkle the top with the remaining cookie crumbs.  Cover and chill in fridge at least 2 hours before serving.
