In a #bowl, combine @Parmesan cheese{3/4%cup}, @breadcrumbs{1/2%cup}, @minced garlic{4%tsp}, @dried basil{2%tbsp}, @dried parsley{3%tbsp}, @seasoned salt{2%tsp}, @eggs{2} and mix well.
Add @ground beef{1.75%lb} and blend, trying not to work the meat too much (works best with your hands).
Form small balls of the meat and place on a #cookie sheet{}.
Bake at 400 for 15-20 minutes (this could be longer or shorter depending on the size of the meatballs).
Divide meatballs into 2 freezer bags.  Add 7-8 cups of @spaghetti sauce{16%cups} in each bag.
To cook: take out of freezer the morning you plan to cook.  Heat in a pan and simmer for 20 minutes.
