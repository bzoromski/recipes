Add @GF Bisquick Pancake & Baking Mix{1%cup} into a #mixing bowl{.}  Note: If using full 16oz box, triple the recipe.
Mix @olive oil{2%tbsp} with @milk{1/3%cup} and @eggs{2} and stir that all at once into the baking mix.
Drop combined mix by teaspoonfuls into a bubbling soup broth, cover immediately and simmer for at least 15 minutes WITHOUT LIFTING THE LID.  (The dumplings will probably fall, or flatten, if you lift the lid before they're done.)
