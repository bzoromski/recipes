Put @Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix{1@packet}, @salsa verde green salsa{8%oz}, @washed cilantro with stems{1/2%bunch}, @minced garlic{1%tsp}, @mayo{1/4%cup}, @sour cream{1/4%cup}, @hot sauce{1/8%tsp} into a blender and mix until smooth and creamy.  Add @buttermilk to thin if needed.  It will be thin at first and thicken over time.  If you do not have buttermilk, regular milk works just fine.  This is great on tacos, salads, chip dip, etc.
