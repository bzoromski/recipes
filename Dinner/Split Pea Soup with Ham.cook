In a #large pot{} or Dutch oven, melt @butter{1/4%cup} until foaming subsides.  Add @chopped onion{2%cups}, @diced carrot{1%cup}, @diced celery{1%cup}, @kosher salt{1/4%tsp}, and @ground black pepper{1/2%tsp}.  Cook until vegetables are softened and just beginning to brown, 5-8 minutes.  Add @minced garlic{1%tsp} and cook for 1 minute, until aromatic.  Stir in @dried split peas{1%lb}.
Add @meaty ham bone{1}, @small bay leaves{2}, @chopped fresh thyme leaves{1%tsp}.  Stir in @chicken stock{6%cups} and @water{2%cups}.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 60-90 minutes, stirring occasionally, until split peas are cooked down and soup is thickened to desired consistency.  (Stir more frequently as the soup begins to thicken and add a little additional stock or water if it gets too thick for your tastes.)
Add @diced ham{1%cup} during last 15 minutes of cooking.  When ready to serve, remove and discard ham bone and bay leaves, and stir in an additional @chopped fresh thyme leaves{1%tsp}.  Season to taste with salt, if needed.  Serve hot with @croutons and cracked black pepper.
